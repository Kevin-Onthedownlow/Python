    "In tutorial t03c, we extracted information from movies of pulsing jellyfish.  For this assignment, you must develop an image analysis pipeline for the Cassiopea pulsation movies.  Pose a set of hypotheses or questions to answer (see examples at end of t03c); and then compare and contrast measurements for day-time and night-time pulsing data, and among the individual jellyfish.  Graphically present your results, discuss any/all conclusions from your data analysis, and provide suggestions for further experiments you may have based on what is implicated by your data."

    "Submit one zip'd file per group, which contains the .ipynb file, a .pdf of that file, and finally, the .csv file(s) of your ROIs (see t03c).  Name files according to (first initial + last name) of each group member (e.g., PS04_nnibras_jtreweek).  For ease of grading, you must call-up the original data without changing the name of the folders: 'cassiopea_pulsation', or 'day', or 'night'. So, your first lines of code for daytime and night-time image data should look something like this:\n",

    "**Contributions:** Reminder - students should list a contributions section (e.g., Tanja Trojan hypothesized what parameters might be interesting to look at, Tommy Trojan coded up the plotting for EDA, both Tanja and Tommy analysed plots and decided on statistical analysis approach in order to draw conclusions)."
